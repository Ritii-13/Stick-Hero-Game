# Stick Hero Game

## Overview

Stick Hero Game is an imitation of the Stick Hero game developed by Ritika Thakur for the AP Deadline-II project. The game is built using Java, JavaFX, and XML to create an interactive gaming experience.

## Instructions

1. **Launch the Game**: To start the game, initiate the `GameApplication.java` file located at `src/main/java/com.example.stickheroap`.

2. **Gameplay**: 
   - Press the play button to start the game.
   - Use the space bar to extend the stick. Release the space bar to drop the stick onto the next platform.
   - The stick's length must be precise to reach the next platform. If it's too short or too long, the hero falls, and the game ends.

3. **Sound Control**:
   - Click on the sound icon to toggle sound on or off.

4. **Leaderboard and Saved Games**:
   - Click on the leaderboard icon to view the leaderboard.
   - Click on the saved games icon to access saved games.

5. **Game Over**:
   - When the hero falls, the game over screen appears with all buttons clickable.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: Core programming language used for game logic.
- **JavaFX**: GUI framework for building interactive applications.
- **FXML**: XML-based markup language for defining user interface elements.

## Folder Structure

- `src/main/java/com.example.stickheroap`: Contains Java source files.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains FXML files for UI layout and styling.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The gameplay involves extending a stick from one platform to another to help the hero cross a gap between platforms. The player must release the stick at the precise moment to ensure it's long enough to reach the next platform but not too long to cause the hero to fall. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the platforms move further apart.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Graphics**: Enhance visual elements such as background scenery, hero animation, and platform design.
- **Levels and Challenges**: Implement different levels with increasing difficulty and introduce challenges such as moving platforms or obstacles.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Add a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other in real-time.
- **Power-ups and Bonuses**: Introduce power-ups or bonuses to enhance gameplay and add variety.
- **Customization Options**: Allow players to customize their hero's appearance, stick design, and background themes.
